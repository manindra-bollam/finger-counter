# üñêÔ∏è Finger Counter using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Python to count how many fingers you are holding up in front of your webcam ‚Äî all in real time!

Perfect for beginners in computer vision who want to experiment with hand tracking and gesture recognition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time finger detection using webcam
- ‚úÖ Tracks thumb and four fingers separately
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚úÖ Uses Google‚Äôs MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7‚Äì3.11 (‚úÖ Python 3.10 is recommended)
- `mediapipe`
- `opencv-python`

---

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manindra-bollam/finger-counter.git
cd finger-counter
```

### 2. (Important) Use Python 3.10

MediaPipe is **not compatible with Python 3.13+**. Install Python 3.10 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) if needed.

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
# Activate it:
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Make sure you're inside the virtual environment (you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt).

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mediapipe==0.10.9 opencv-python

```

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Common MediaPipe Errors & Fixes

---

### ‚ùå `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _framework_bindings`

This means MediaPipe failed to load its internal native binaries (DLLs).

**‚úÖ Fix:**

Install the required Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime:

- **[Download Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)**

After installing, restart your computer and try again.

---

### ‚ùå `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe`

This happens if you're using an unsupported Python version (e.g., Python 3.12+).

**‚úÖ Fix:**

MediaPipe officially supports **Python 3.8 ‚Äì 3.11**.

1.  Uninstall your current Python version if needed.
2.  Install a compatible version like Python 3.10 from the official website:
    - **[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)**

---

### ‚ùå `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'`

You probably typed `pip install cv2`, which is incorrect.

**‚úÖ Fix:**

The correct package name is `opencv-python`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python

```

### ‚ùå MediaPipe works on one Python version but fails on another

This happens when you're not running the script in the same environment where you installed the packages.

‚úÖ **Fix:**

Ensure you're using the same Python version where MediaPipe was installed. Always activate your virtual environment before running the script:

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOs/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
